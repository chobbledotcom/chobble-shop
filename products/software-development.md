If you want custom software writing, I can help. I prefer to write Ruby on Rails webapps and Ruby scripts, but I can work with whatever language or ecosystem you'd prefer.

If you own existing custom software and you want to tweak its behaviour, I might be able to help there too. There's usually a way around most techy problems, and after three decades of playing with computers I have a good knack for fixing and automating things.

You'll have to contact me for a quote for software development, because the scope can vary so much.
