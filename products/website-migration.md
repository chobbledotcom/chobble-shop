I will migrate your website to a "static" website with (optional) CMS functionality.

Static websites have many advantages:

- They do not require maintenance
- They are generally fast to load
- They can be hosted at very low cost
- Any aspect of them can be edited

If you're generally happy with the look and feel of your website but you feel like its hosting is expensive or burdensome, or if you want flexibility beyond your current CMS system, a migration is a good choice.

You won't lose any content and as far as visitors to your site will be able to tell, nothing will have changed - unless you want it to.

## The process

First, I'll archive your existing site using **wget**, a great open source tool. After a manual check to make sure everything is working, I'll host this site on the **Bunny CDN** for **£10 per month** - or you can arrange hosting.

The price for this could be as low as **£200**, for an average-complexity website - more if you also need me to migrate your emails and domain name.

**If you don't want to edit your site, that's all we need to do.** But if you want a **Content Management System** to edit your migrated site, then I'll need to adjust the archived pages to be editable via the **PagesCMS** system.

The complexity of that job would depend on how big your site is and how many types of pages it contains, but generally I'd expect it to **add another £200-600 to the price**.

## The results

You'll have a site which retains all of your favourite bits from your old one but loads really quickly, is editable by any nerd who knows HTML, and isn't tied to any specific supplier - I'll give you the full source code powering your site for you to take wherever you like.
