I prefer static websites to WordPress, usually - Wordpress is kind of a pain to work with and staying on top of plugins and updates is a maintenance job I'd rather avoid.

But WordPress has its uses - the big one is that it's got a load of nice themes to pick from, and that you can host an e-commerce site on it fairly easily with no fees beyond Stripe's.

You may also have an existing WordPress site you like and want to keep, but you'd like me to tweak it for you, or migrate it to cheaper hosting, or help you improve its SEO.

Whatever it is you need - I can help.
