Hosting a static site can be really cheap - just a few £s per month should be enough for the majority of sites. This means that my pricing really comes down to whether you want support or not:

## Support included

I can up to 20 static websites for you for **£40 per month** with **unlimited email addresses, unlimited support and advice, plus regular check-ins to see how your sites are performing**.

For businesses looking to grow their web presence, this is a good deal - it's comparable to sites like Wix, except you'll get a lot more support.

## No support included

If you don't need any support because you're happy with how your site is doing, I can host **one website and one email address with no support other than bug fixes** for **£10 per month**. Support will be billed at my hourly rate (£200).

This is a really affordable option for established businesses and is much cheaper than you could find elsewhere without becoming a nerd yourself - **but it can only be paid annually at £120/year.**
