---
I'm running [Traccar](https://traccar.org) on my server. It's an open source application for tracking GPS devices and supports loads of protocols of common trackers.

I'll give you an account on my server for you to track your whole fleet of vehicles, for £100 per year - much cheaper than commercial offerings

You'll need your own GPS receivers with SIM cards in, which you'll wire into your vehicle's power. I can advise you on devices if you haven't got any.
