If you're in North Manchester, I can come to your home for tech tutoring at £50 per hour (min 2 hours). For this price I will work with you on any problem you might have - whether that's learning to make a website, to upgrade your home computer, to set up a smart home - whatever.

I have about 30 years of experience of playing with technology and have done all sorts in that time, and have learned how to diagnose and debug problems in a way which is reproducible for all sorts of situations. I can teach you some of these tricks to set you on your own path.

**This price does not apply to commercial ventures.** If you're going to make money directly from the thing we're doing together, then I will charge my normal freelance rate of £200 per hour. This discounted price is for **educational services only**.
