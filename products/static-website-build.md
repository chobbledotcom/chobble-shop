I can build you a website based on the **Chobble Template**, an open source template for small business websites. You can read all about it at [example.chobble.com](https://example.chobble.com).

The price will depend on how much work is involved and how much of that work you want to handle yourself.

## Cheap web development

To get the price as low as possible you will need to **provide the images yourself** and **write the content yourself** because those are the most time-consuming and expensive jobs.

If you **have your own domain name and email address**, even better - some of the price accounts for figuring those out.

## Hands-off development

If you want me to manage the whole website from start to finish - no problem! I can buy the domain and email addresses, build the site, populate it with content, source images, and even promote the site once and build links once it's up and running.

I'll need your input for some of these jobs - but that can be as simple as sending me voice notes on WhatsApp.

**I am committed to 100% transparency with my customers for all jobs, even well-paying ones.** You will get a full breakdown of the work I undertook for you, and hopefully you'll agree that I was good value for money.
