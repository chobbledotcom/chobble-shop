If you've got a laptop which Windows 11 doesn't support, or if you'd just like to switch to an operating system that treats you nicely, you might be interested in my Linux laptop upgrade service.

I'll install Ubuntu Linux on your laptop and show you how it works. Chances are it'll "just work" with all of your laptop's peripherals, but if you need to swap WIFi cards (the most common problem) it's an easy, cheap fix.
